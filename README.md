# Explanation:
Data import and usage platform.

# Setup
The GUI and TUI files are the executable files but you shouldn't run them without compiling the code, they were used for test purposes.
To compile the program first clone the repo with "git clone https://github.com/Claracinus0Manaricanus/geoInf.git" and enter the directory geoInf.
Then you should be able to compile with "cmake --build ." but if you have problems delete CMakeFiles directory and Makefile, CMakeCache.txt and cmake_install.cmake files.
Then run "cmake ." and try "cmake --build ." again. It should give you 2 files name GUI and TUI. These are the executables you can run with "./TUI" or "./GUI".

# Usage
Right now only TUI is actively developed and usable though it has a lot of missing functionality such as searching.
